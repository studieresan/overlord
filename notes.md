These notes are from studs 2025 where the server stopped working and had to be rebuilt from scratch.

This was done by install a new ubuntu build and then installing the following packages:
    nginx
    nodejs
    npm
    cloning the git repo 
    install mongodb (https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/)

The domain is hosted in cloudflare.
